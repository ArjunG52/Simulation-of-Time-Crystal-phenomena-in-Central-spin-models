The goal of this project is to reproduce the results of the paper, focusing on the emergence of time-crystalline behavior in central-spin systems with Heisenberg interactions. The simulations are performed using numerical methods, and the results are compared with the findings in the paper.

## Introduction
The paper explores the emergence of time-crystalline behavior in central-spin systems with Heisenberg interactions. Time crystals are non-equilibrium phases of matter that exhibit periodic behavior in time, even in the absence of external driving. The authors show that time-crystalline behavior can arise in central-spin systems with Heisenberg interactions by either applying a large Zeeman splitting to the central spin or by using additional pulses to dynamically convert Heisenberg interactions into effective Ising interactions.

This repository contains the code to simulate the central-spin model and reproduce the results presented in the paper. The simulations are performed using Python, with the help of the QuSpin library for exact diagonalization of quantum many-body systems.

As some simulations very computationally expensive, I have not recreated the figures but the code for the same is uploaded.
## Acknowledgments
This project is based on the paper by Frantzeskakis et al. (arXiv:2303.00893v2). The authors would like to thank the contributors to the QuSpin library for providing tools for exact diagonalization of quantum many-body systems.
